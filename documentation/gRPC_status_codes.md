|    9     | FAILED_PRECONDITION |   400    | Операция отменена, так как не выполняются условия, необходимые для проведения операции.The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE: (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. |
|    10    |       ABORTED       |   409    | The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.

|    11    |    OUT_OF_RANGE     |   400    | The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and OUT_OF_RANGE. We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when they are done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

All RPCs started at a client return a status object composed of an integer code and a string message. The server-side can choose the status it returns for a given RPC. Applications should only use values defined above. gRPC libraries that encounter values outside this range must either propagate them directly or convert them to UNKNOWN.

The gRPC client and server-side implementations may also generate and return status on their own when errors happen. Only a subset of the pre-defined status codes are generated by the gRPC libraries. This allows applications to be sure that any other code it sees was actually returned by the application (although it is also possible for the server-side to return one of the codes generated by the gRPC libraries).

The following table lists the codes that may be returned by the gRPC libraries (on either the client-side or server-side) and summarizes the situations in which they are generated.

The following status codes are never generated by the library:

- INVALID_ARGUMENT
- NOT_FOUND
- ALREADY_EXISTS
- FAILED_PRECONDITION
- ABORTED
- OUT_OF_RANGE
- DATA_LOSS

Applications that may wish to retry failed RPCs must decide which status codes on which to retry. As shown in the table above, the gRPC library can generate the same status code for different cases. Server applications can also return those same status codes. Therefore, there is no fixed list of status codes on which it is appropriate to retry in all applications. As a result, individual applications must make their own determination as to which status codes should cause an RPC to be retried.
